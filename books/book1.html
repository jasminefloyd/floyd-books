    <h1>Meet Chase Montgomery</h1>
    <p>Meet Chase Montgomery, the reigning queen of Hudson Prep, an exclusive Manhattan private school where wealth and privilege are the norm. But beneath her polished exterior lies a secret identity: the leader of the Manhattan Midnight Club, a clandestine group of teenage thieves targeting the corrupt elite of New York City.</p>

    <p>With her street smarts, sharp wit, and natural leadership skills, Chase orchestrates daring heists with her crew: Ben, the tech genius; Ella, the smooth-talking con artist; and Jackson, the agile parkour expert. Their mission is to expose the dark secrets of the powerful and redistribute their ill-gotten gains to those in need.</p>
